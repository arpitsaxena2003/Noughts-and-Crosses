# Noughts-and-Crosses
"Noughts and Crosses," is a simple two-player strategy game. The game is typically played on a 3x3 grid where one player uses "X" and the other player uses "O". The objective is to be the first to get three of your marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Game Setup:

The grid consists of 9 cells arranged in three rows and three columns.

Players take turns to place their symbol (either "X" or "O") in an empty cell.

Rules:

Turn-taking: Players alternate turns, starting with the player who is assigned "X."

Winning condition: A player wins if they place three of their symbols consecutively in a row, column, or diagonal.

Draw: The game results in a draw (or tie) if all cells are filled and neither player has achieved the winning condition.

Strategies:

Offensive: Try to create opportunities for two of your marks in a row, forcing your opponent to block while setting up future wins.

Defensive: Always block your opponent's attempts to complete three marks in a row.

Forking: A strategic move where you create multiple opportunities to win, forcing your opponent into a position where they cannot block all possibilities.

often used as a basic example of game theory and teaches young players fundamental concepts of strategy and foresight. While it is a simple game, the optimal strategies can make it very challenging to win against an experienced player, and with perfect play from both sides, the game usually ends in a draw.
